# HelpElders
The internet is fast-paced, overflowing with information, and often hard to navigate. TheGoodNeighbor is here to bring you the daily news and lend you a helping hand when you need it. We want to help increase accesibility to the digital world, especially for those of older generations. Nowadays information, products, and services are all on the internet, but without improving accessibility, there remains communities of people that are being left behind.

It's not always easy to leave the house and travel for the things and services you need, so our volunteers are here to be your good neighbors and help provide access to these services online. We hope that our simple interface will assist you in navigating the clutter of the internet.
