    <about1>The internet is fast-paced, overflowing with information, and often hard to navigate. TheGoodNeighbor is here to bring you the daily news and lend you a helping hand when you need it. We want to help increase accesibility to the digital world, especially for those of older generations. Nowadays information, products, and services are all on the internet, but without improving accessibility, there remains communities of people that are being left behind.</about1>
